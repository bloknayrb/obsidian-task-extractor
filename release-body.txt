## üöÄ Task Extractor v2.3.0 - Enhanced Prompt Engineering

This release delivers a completely rewritten task extraction prompt based on research into prompt engineering best practices, significantly improving accuracy and reliability.

### ‚ú® What's New

#### Advanced Prompt Engineering
- **Multi-stage Analysis Framework**: Systematic 3-step process (Context Analysis ‚Üí Task Identification ‚Üí Information Extraction)
- **Chain-of-thought Reasoning**: Built-in validation checkpoints and quality assurance steps
- **Conservative Extraction**: "Accuracy over completeness" principle with confidence scoring
- **Hallucination Prevention**: Strong validation rules and explicit null handling for uncertain information

#### Enhanced Task Detection
- **Improved Accuracy**: Research-backed techniques reduce false positives and improve task quality
- **Better Context Understanding**: Enhanced document type identification and project/client mapping
- **Confidence Assessment**: Three-tier confidence scoring (high/medium/low) with extraction thresholds
- **Professional Output**: Cleaner, more actionable task titles and descriptions

#### Metadata Integration Improvements
- **TaskNotes Compatibility**: Enhanced frontmatter integration aligned with TaskNotes repository patterns
- **Better Field Extraction**: Improved project/client detection with explicit null handling
- **Quality Standards**: Specific action verbs, measurable outcomes, and feasibility checks
- **Structured Output**: Detailed JSON schema with field specifications and format examples

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### Prompt Architecture
- **Structured Design**: Clear role definition with hierarchical instruction organization
- **Quality Standards**: Explicit filtering criteria and mandatory exclusions
- **Validation Rules**: Built-in checkpoints to ensure extraction quality
- **Conservative Approach**: Extract only with medium or high confidence

#### Better Reliability
- **Reduced False Positives**: Strict criteria for actionable tasks with specific exclusions
- **Enhanced Validation**: Multiple validation steps before finalizing extractions
- **Improved Consistency**: Standardized output format with detailed specifications
- **Error Prevention**: Robust handling of edge cases and ambiguous content

### üìà User Experience Enhancements

#### More Reliable Extractions
- **Higher Quality Tasks**: Only extract clearly actionable items with specific outcomes
- **Better Context Preservation**: Enhanced source excerpts and justification tracking
- **Improved Metadata**: More accurate priority assignment and due date extraction
- **Professional Language**: Cleaner, action-oriented task titles using active verbs

#### Enhanced Documentation
- **Updated README**: New section highlighting enhanced prompt features
- **Configuration Guide**: Updated custom prompt documentation with examples
- **Reset Functionality**: Enhanced default prompt with improved substitution

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This release maintains full backward compatibility while delivering significant improvements:

- **Existing Configurations**: All current settings and customizations continue to work unchanged
- **API Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing integrations
- **Performance**: Enhanced prompt delivers better results without performance impact
- **Extensibility**: Improved foundation for future prompt engineering enhancements

### üéØ Research-Backed Improvements

Based on comprehensive research into prompt engineering best practices:

- **Multi-provider Analysis**: Studied OpenAI, Anthropic, and academic prompt engineering guidelines
- **TaskNotes Integration**: Analyzed successful task management frontmatter patterns
- **Hallucination Prevention**: Implemented techniques from constitutional AI research
- **Structured Extraction**: Applied systematic approaches for reliable information extraction

### üîÑ Migration

**No action required** - this update is fully backward compatible:

- Existing custom prompts continue to work unchanged
- Default prompt automatically uses enhanced version
- Reset functionality updates to new enhanced default
- All settings and configurations preserved
