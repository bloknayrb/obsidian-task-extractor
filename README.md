### Frontmatter Customization

The plugin generates task notes with customizable frontmatter. Default fields include:

```yaml
task: "Task title extracted by LLM"
status: "todo"
priority: "medium"
due: "2025-01-15"  # If date mentioned
project: "Project name"  # If identified
client: "Client name"  # If mentioned
created: "2025-08-08"  # Auto-generated
tags: "task"
```

#### Adding Custom Fields
1. Go to **Settings → Task Note Frontmatter**
2. Click **Add Field**
3. Configure:
   - **Key**: Frontmatter field name
   - **Type**: text, date, select, boolean
   - **Default Value**: Used when LLM doesn't provide value
   - **Required**: Whether field must be present

#### Field Types
- **Text**: Free-form text input
- **Date**: ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Select**: Dropdown with predefined options
- **Boolean**: True/false values

#### Special Values
- `{{date}}` - Replaced with current date
- LLM extractions override default values when available

### Trigger Configuration

Notes are processed when they have frontmatter matching trigger types:

```yaml
---
Type: Email  # This will trigger processing
---
```

**Default trigger types**: `Email`, `MeetingNote`, `Meeting Note`, `Meeting Notes`

**Customization**: Add/remove trigger types in settings (comma-separated list)

#### Flexible Frontmatter Field Configuration

**NEW**: You can now customize which frontmatter field is used for filtering notes:

```yaml
---
Category: Email     # Custom field instead of "Type"
NoteType: Meeting   # Or any other field name
---
```

**Configuration**:
1. Go to **Settings → Processing Settings**
2. Set **Frontmatter field for filtering** to your preferred field name
3. Ensure your notes use this field consistently

**Benefits**:
- Adapt to existing note templates and workflows
- Use more descriptive field names that match your system
- Maintain consistency with other plugins or tools
- Backward compatible - defaults to "Type" if not configured

**Validation**: Field names must follow YAML key format (letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, dots)

### File/Folder Exclusions

**NEW**: Prevent specific files or folders from being processed with flexible exclusion rules:

#### Excluded Paths (Exact Matches)
Specify exact file or folder paths to exclude:
```
Templates/
Archive/Old Notes/
Private/secrets.md
```

#### Exclusion Patterns (Wildcards)
Use glob patterns for flexible matching:
```
*.template.md     # All template files
**/drafts/**     # Any drafts folder and contents  
Archive/**       # Entire Archive folder
temp?.md         # temp1.md, temp2.md, etc.
```

#### Wildcard Support
- `*` - Matches any characters except `/` (single directory level)
- `**` - Matches any characters including `/` (multiple directory levels)
- `?` - Matches exactly one character

#### Configuration
1. Go to **Settings → File/Folder Exclusion Settings**
2. Add comma-separated paths or patterns
3. Both exact paths and patterns can be used together
4. Changes apply immediately to new file processing

#### Use Cases
- **Templates**: Exclude template files from being processed
- **Archives**: Skip old/completed notes  
- **Personal**: Exclude private or sensitive folders
- **Drafts**: Skip work-in-progress notes
- **System**: Exclude generated or temporary files

### Advanced Settings

#### Performance Tuning
- **Max Tokens**: Control response length (100-2000) - Enhanced slider with input field
- **Temperature**: Creativity level (0=deterministic, 1=creative) - Enhanced slider with input field
- **Timeout**: Request timeout in seconds (10-120) - Enhanced slider with input field

**NEW**: Enhanced slider components provide both slider and direct numeric input with:
- Bidirectional synchronization between slider and input field
- Real-time validation with bounds checking
- Visual feedback for invalid values
- Improved accessibility and user experience

#### Local LLM Settings
- **Service URLs**: Configure custom endpoints
- **Model Refresh Interval**: How often to check for new models
- **Auto-detection**: Automatic service availability monitoring

#### Processing Options
- **Process Edits**: React to note modifications (not just creation)
- **Link Back**: Include source note links in tasks
- **Processed Marker**: Frontmatter key to prevent reprocessing

### Custom Prompts

Override the default task extraction prompt for specialized use cases:

```
You are a task extraction assistant specialized in [your domain]. 
Look for tasks specifically assigned to [Owner Name].
Focus on [specific criteria]...
```

Leave empty to use the default prompt.
