## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

#### Method 1: Manual Installation
1. Download the latest release from GitHub
2. Extract to `.obsidian/plugins/task-extractor/` in your vault
3. Enable the plugin in Obsidian Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins

#### Method 2: Development Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/bryanjkolb/obsidian-task-extractor.git
cd obsidian-task-extractor
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# For development with auto-rebuild
npm run dev
```

### Basic Configuration

1. Open **Settings ‚Üí Task Extractor**
2. Choose your **LLM Provider**:
   - **Cloud providers**: Add your API key
   - **Local providers**: Ensure Ollama/LM Studio is running
3. Set your **Owner Name** (who tasks should be assigned to)
4. Configure **Tasks Folder** location
5. Customize **Trigger Note Types** as needed

## üîß Configuration Guide

### LLM Provider Setup

#### OpenAI
- Get API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com)
- Recommended model: `gpt-4o-mini` (cost-effective)
- Add API key in plugin settings

#### Anthropic
- Get API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com)
- Recommended model: `claude-3-haiku-20240307` (fast and affordable)
- Add API key in plugin settings

#### Ollama (Local)
1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/)
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.2`
3. Start Ollama service
4. Plugin will auto-detect available models

#### LM Studio (Local)
1. Install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
2. Download and load a model
3. Start the local server (default: http://localhost:1234)
4. Plugin will auto-detect loaded models

### Frontmatter Customization

The plugin generates task notes with customizable frontmatter. Default fields include:

```yaml
task: "Task title extracted by LLM"
status: "todo"
priority: "medium"
due: "2025-01-15"  # If date mentioned
project: "Project name"  # If identified
client: "Client name"  # If mentioned
created: "2025-08-08"  # Auto-generated
tags: "task"
```

#### Adding Custom Fields
1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Task Note Frontmatter**
2. Click **Add Field**
3. Configure:
   - **Key**: Frontmatter field name
   - **Type**: text, date, select, boolean
   - **Default Value**: Used when LLM doesn't provide value
   - **Required**: Whether field must be present

#### Field Types
- **Text**: Free-form text input
- **Date**: ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Select**: Dropdown with predefined options
- **Boolean**: True/false values

#### Special Values
- `{{date}}` - Replaced with current date
- LLM extractions override default values when available

### Trigger Configuration

Notes are processed when they have frontmatter matching trigger types:

```yaml
---
Type: Email  # This will trigger processing
---
```

**Default trigger types**: `Email`, `MeetingNote`, `Meeting Note`, `Meeting Notes`

**Customization**: Add/remove trigger types in settings (comma-separated list)

#### Flexible Frontmatter Field Configuration

**NEW**: You can now customize which frontmatter field is used for filtering notes:

```yaml
---
Category: Email     # Custom field instead of "Type"
NoteType: Meeting   # Or any other field name
---
```

**Configuration**:
1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Processing Settings**
2. Set **Frontmatter field for filtering** to your preferred field name
3. Ensure your notes use this field consistently

**Benefits**:
- Adapt to existing note templates and workflows
- Use more descriptive field names that match your system
- Maintain consistency with other plugins or tools
- Backward compatible - defaults to "Type" if not configured

**Validation**: Field names must follow YAML key format (letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, dots)

### Advanced Settings

#### Performance Tuning
- **Max Tokens**: Control response length (100-2000) - Enhanced slider with input field
- **Temperature**: Creativity level (0=deterministic, 1=creative) - Enhanced slider with input field
- **Timeout**: Request timeout in seconds (10-120) - Enhanced slider with input field
- **Retry Attempts**: Failed request retries (1-5) - Enhanced slider with input field

**NEW**: Enhanced slider components provide both slider and direct numeric input with:
- Bidirectional synchronization between slider and input field
- Real-time validation with bounds checking
- Visual feedback for invalid values
- Improved accessibility and user experience

#### Local LLM Settings
- **Service URLs**: Configure custom endpoints
- **Model Refresh Interval**: How often to check for new models
- **Auto-detection**: Automatic service availability monitoring

#### Processing Options
- **Process Edits**: React to note modifications (not just creation)
- **Link Back**: Include source note links in tasks
- **Processed Marker**: Frontmatter key to prevent reprocessing

### Custom Prompts

Override the default task extraction prompt for specialized use cases:

```
You are a task extraction assistant specialized in [your domain]. 
Look for tasks specifically assigned to [Owner Name].
Focus on [specific criteria]...
```

Leave empty to use the default prompt.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No models available" for Local LLMs
- **Ollama**: Run `ollama pull llama3.2` to download a model
- **LM Studio**: Load a model in the LM Studio interface
- Check service URLs in plugin settings

#### "API key not configured"
- Add valid API key in plugin settings
- Verify key has appropriate permissions
- Check API key format (starts with `sk-` for OpenAI)

#### Tasks not being created
1. Check note has correct `Type` frontmatter
2. Verify trigger types in settings match your notes
3. Ensure LLM can identify tasks for the specified owner name
4. Check console logs for detailed error messages

#### Service detection issues
- Verify local services are running on correct ports
- Check firewall/network settings
- Try manual service URL configuration
- Restart plugin after starting local services

### Debug Mode & Logging

The plugin includes comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities:

#### Enable Debug Mode
1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Task Extractor ‚Üí Logging and Debugging**
2. Toggle **Enable Debug Mode**
3. Set **Log Level** (Error, Warning, Info, Debug)
4. Enable **Performance Timing** to track operation speeds

#### View Logs
- **Console**: Open Developer Console (Ctrl+Shift+I) and filter by "TaskExtractor"
- **Export**: Use "Export Logs" button to copy logs to clipboard
- **Statistics**: View log counts, error rates, and average operation times
- **Recent Logs**: "View Recent Logs" outputs last 50 entries to console

#### Log Features
- **Structured Output**: Each log includes timestamp, level, operation, timing, and context
- **Performance Monitoring**: Automatic timing for LLM calls, file operations, and task extraction
- **Memory Management**: Track memory usage and cleanup operations
- **Error Details**: Detailed error context with provider, model, and file information
- **Search & Filter**: Built-in log search functionality for troubleshooting

### Performance Issues

- Reduce **Max Tokens** for faster responses
- Increase **Timeout** for slow local models
- Use smaller/faster models for local inference
- Adjust **Model Refresh Interval** to reduce background checks

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Optimized Modular Design
The plugin uses a modern modular architecture for better performance and maintainability:

- **main.ts** - Plugin orchestration and backward compatibility layer
- **src/types.ts** - Shared type definitions and constants
- **src/llm-providers.ts** - LLM provider management with on-demand detection
- **src/task-processor.ts** - Debounced file processing and batch operations

### Performance Features
- **Debounced Processing**: 2-second delays prevent redundant file processing during rapid edits
- **On-Demand Service Detection**: Services detected only when needed, cached for 30 minutes
- **Batch Operations**: Large vault scans process files in groups of 5 with 100ms delays
- **Optimized Settings**: 500ms debounced saves reduce I/O operations
- **Proper Cleanup**: All timeouts and caches cleaned up on plugin unload

### Backward Compatibility
All existing APIs are preserved exactly, ensuring zero breaking changes for users upgrading from previous versions.

```

### API Integration

The plugin provides a unified interface for multiple LLM providers:

```typescript
// Example LLM call
const result = await this.callLLM(systemPrompt, userPrompt);

// Service detection
const services = await this.detectServices();
const available = this.getAvailableServices();
```

### Extension Points

- **Custom Providers**: Add new LLM providers in `callLLM` method
- **Field Types**: Extend frontmatter field types
- **Prompt Templates**: Customize extraction prompts
- **Post-processing**: Add custom task note formatting
