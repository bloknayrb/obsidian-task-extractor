# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a debug mode option to the Obsidian Task Extractor plugin settings that enables comprehensive logging of plugin actions. The debug mode will provide users with visibility into the plugin's processing behavior, allowing them to review what actions the plugin has taken and determine if any configuration adjustments are needed to improve task extraction accuracy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a plugin user, I want to enable debug mode in the settings, so that I can monitor and review all plugin activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the plugin settings THEN the system SHALL display a debug mode toggle option
2. WHEN the user enables debug mode THEN the system SHALL begin logging all plugin actions
3. WHEN the user disables debug mode THEN the system SHALL stop logging new actions
4. IF debug mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL persist the debug mode state across Obsidian restarts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a plugin user, I want to view a comprehensive log of plugin actions, so that I can understand what the plugin is doing with my notes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL log file processing events with timestamps
2. WHEN the plugin processes a note THEN the system SHALL log the note path, frontmatter type, and processing decision
3. WHEN the plugin extracts tasks THEN the system SHALL log the number of tasks found and their content
4. WHEN the plugin creates task notes THEN the system SHALL log the created file paths and success status
5. WHEN LLM API calls are made THEN the system SHALL log the provider used, request payload, response data, token usage, and response status
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a plugin user, I want to access and review the debug logs easily, so that I can troubleshoot issues and optimize my configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide a way to view logs within the plugin settings
2. WHEN the user views debug logs THEN the system SHALL display logs in chronological order with timestamps
3. WHEN the log becomes large THEN the system SHALL limit log entries to prevent performance issues
4. IF the user wants to clear logs THEN the system SHALL provide a clear logs button
5. WHEN logs are displayed THEN the system SHALL format them in a readable way with proper categorization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a plugin user, I want the debug logs to help me identify configuration issues, so that I can improve task extraction accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a note is skipped THEN the system SHALL log the reason why it was not processed
2. WHEN task extraction fails THEN the system SHALL log the original LLM request, LLM response, and parsing errors
3. WHEN duplicate tasks are detected THEN the system SHALL log the duplicate detection logic results
4. WHEN frontmatter validation fails THEN the system SHALL log which fields failed validation
5. IF LLM provider detection fails THEN the system SHALL log available providers and selection logic

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a plugin user, I want debug mode to have minimal performance impact, so that my Obsidian experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug mode is disabled THEN the system SHALL not perform any logging operations
2. WHEN debug mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL use efficient logging mechanisms
3. WHEN the log reaches maximum size THEN the system SHALL automatically rotate or truncate old entries
4. IF logging fails THEN the system SHALL not interrupt normal plugin operation
5. WHEN debug logs are stored THEN the system SHALL use minimal memory and storage resources
