# Requirements Document: Obsidian API Compliance Improvements

## Introduction

Based on the Context7 review of official Obsidian developer documentation, we identified two specific areas where our plugin could better align with Obsidian's recommended APIs while maintaining our current performance optimizations. This spec focuses on adopting the officially recommended approaches for frontmatter processing and network requests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontmatter Processing API Compliance

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want to use Obsidian's recommended frontmatter API so that my plugin follows best practices and avoids potential conflicts with other plugins.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing frontmatter THEN the plugin SHALL use `FileManager.processFrontMatter` instead of manual regex parsing
2. WHEN marking files as processed THEN the operation SHALL run atomically to prevent conflicts
3. WHEN frontmatter is modified THEN the YAML layout SHALL remain consistent with Obsidian's formatting
4. WHEN multiple plugins modify frontmatter THEN conflicts SHALL be avoided through proper API usage
5. WHEN frontmatter processing fails THEN appropriate error handling SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 2: Network Request API Compliance

**User Story:** As a plugin user, I want network requests to work reliably across all platforms (desktop and mobile) so that the plugin functions consistently regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making HTTP requests THEN the plugin SHALL use Obsidian's `requestUrl` API instead of standard `fetch`
2. WHEN running on mobile platforms THEN network requests SHALL work without compatibility issues
3. WHEN network requests fail THEN error handling SHALL remain consistent with current behavior
4. WHEN timeout occurs THEN the plugin SHALL handle it gracefully using the existing timeout settings
5. WHEN switching between providers THEN network compatibility SHALL be maintained across all platforms

### Requirement 3: Maintain Current Performance

**User Story:** As a plugin user, I want these API improvements to maintain the current performance optimizations so that I don't experience any regression in speed or efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API changes are implemented THEN startup time SHALL remain 60% faster than original
2. WHEN processing files THEN debouncing and batch processing SHALL continue to work
3. WHEN detecting services THEN on-demand caching SHALL remain functional
4. WHEN using settings THEN debounced saves SHALL continue to work
5. WHEN unloading plugin THEN cleanup SHALL remain complete and efficient

### Requirement 4: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a plugin user, I want API improvements to be seamless so that I don't need to reconfigure anything or experience any breaking changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN plugin updates THEN all existing settings SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN API changes are applied THEN user experience SHALL remain identical
3. WHEN frontmatter processing changes THEN existing processed files SHALL continue to work
4. WHEN network API changes THEN all LLM providers SHALL continue to function
5. WHEN plugin loads THEN no migration or user action SHALL be required
